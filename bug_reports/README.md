# Bug reports

This folder contains bug reports created based on:

- functional testing
- observed application behavior
- test design artifacts (EP, BVA, Decision Tables)

The bug reports are written in a structured QA format and describe issues in detail, including steps to reproduce and actual vs expected results.

Each bug report includes (where applicable):

- Bug ID / Title
- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected results
- Actual results
- Severity / Priority
- Environment details
- Notes / Screenshots

Bug reports are written for demo and educational purposes.  
Some applications used are demo environments; therefore, reported bugs may reflect logical issues or deviations from expected behavior rather than production defects.  

Related test cases can be found in the **test-cases** folder.
