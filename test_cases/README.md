# Test cases
This folder contains functional test cases created based on:
- product requirements
- application behavior
- test design artifacts (EP, BVA, Decision Tables)

The test cases are written in a structured QA format and describe
step-by-step actions and expected results.

Each test case includes (where applicable):
- Preconditions
- Test steps
- Expected results
- Environment details

## Notes
- Test cases are written for demo and educational purposes.
- Some applications used are demo environments, therefore expected results may
  describe logical or expected behavior rather than actual system behavior.
- Related test design documents can be found in the **test-design** folder.
- Related bug report documents can be found in the **bug-reports** folder.
